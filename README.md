# Breached!
### The Cybersecurity Incident Response Challenge
Breached is a short business management simulation designed to teach people about the basics of cybersecurity. They will gain the skills necessary to keep themselves safe online and learn ways to mitigate cyber threats. It's important to understand how people in non-technical backgrounds can get involved with the cyber industry.

This project was created for a STEM Community Challenge event (2024). It was co-written by Tartarus6(Tar) and Greenturtle537. It's intended to be featured at upcoming social events and job fairs where Lockheed Martin booths may be found. Glitch Technologies is in no way affiliated with Lockheed Martin.
